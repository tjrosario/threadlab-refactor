        <h3 id="answer-what">What is ThreadLab?</h3>
        <p>
          ThreadLab is a scientific, data-driven men's clothing service for regular guys who don't like to shop. (No subscription required.)

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Sign up</h4>
            <p>Signing up for ThreadLab takes about a minute. We ask for some basic information like size, desired price ranges, and the colors you wish to avoid. This helps us and our system understand your sizes, preferences and budget.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Place an order (any time)</h4>
            <p>Placing an order is even faster than signing up. Simply select the Product Categories you need and our system will match your profile with the products we have in stock.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Shipment arrives</h4>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Once your shipment arrives, take up to <span ng-bind="ORDER_MAX_DAYS_TO_RETURN.numeric"></span> days to make sure the clothes meet your needs.</li>
              <li>Check out by logging into Your Account and clicking on your order in Order History.  Request exchanges you need to make if there were any issues with sizing, and provide feedback on anything you want so that your future orders will be even more precise. </li>
              <li>If you decide you need to return, or exchange something, <strong><em>no problem</em></strong>. We always include a self-sealing pre-paid UPS label.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Give feedback that makes the service even better for you</h4>
            <p>Provide as much feedback as possible on every item. We give you a chance to provide feedback at Order Preview and at Self Checkout. This way our system learns more about you and the clothes that will work best, making your future ordering even easier.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you can always give us more details about your preferences by refining your Product Preferences or Brand Preferences in Your Account.</p>

        <p>After you sign up, you can go into Brand Preferences in Your Account to see the brands we carry. You can also eliminate brands so that we only send you brands that you like to wear.</p>
        <p>Overall, our brands are similar to those found at department stores such as Macy's, Lord and Taylor, and Nordstrom Rack. We also occasionally include smaller up and coming brands that offer great quality and value.</p>

        <p>We currently only ship to the contiguous US and are looking to expand as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Big update for our Alaska, Hawaii &amp; APO/FPO  fans:</strong>  we've worked out a way to get our boxes <em>shipped to your door, for free</em>. Please be aware, since we aren't "officially" shipping outside the lower 48 yet, <em>you'll need to cover any shipping costs for items sent back to ThreadLab</em>.  To help make life a bit easier, we include a pre-paid return label.</p>
        <p>If we don't currently ship to your location and you want us to, be sure to send us an email, <a href="mailto:service@mythreadlab.com" id="faq-email00">service@mythreadlab.com</a> so we can know about your interest.</p>

        <h3 id="answer-charges">When will my credit card be charged?</h3>
        <p>
          We charge your card when you place your order. This helps simplify your ThreadLab experience and also allows for better pricing and 365 days to return items.
        </p>

          If you pay with PayPal and qualify for PayPal Credit, you also have the option of deferring or splitting your payments over time.
