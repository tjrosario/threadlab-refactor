        <p>ThreadLab is creating the most convenient and customer-friendly clothing service available to man. Clothing should fit the first time you try it on.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Early in 2008, while getting his MBA at NYU Stern, Will wrote the business plan for ThreadLab and pitched the concept to a few professors.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2011, we watched the subscription shopping and online personal shopping markets evolve with companies like ShoeDazzle, BirchBox, and Trunk Club gaining significant traction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2012, we began testing the existing online and in-store personal shopping services and saw there still was no <em> affordable, low-touch shopping solution.</em>
        </p>


        <p>
          To reinvent men’s clothing shopping, in 2013, we built <em>a team that didn’t come from retail—a team that was not founded in the fashion world—a team with a clean perspective.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          We studied the tedious process of shopping, broke it down, and are making it <em>more efficient and more effective</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ThreadLab is the innovative, affordable, and convenient way to get timeless menswear classics.</strong>
        </p>
